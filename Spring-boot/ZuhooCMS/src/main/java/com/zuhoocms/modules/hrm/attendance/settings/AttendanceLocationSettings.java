/**
 * One company's office-location policy for GPS-verified attendance: where the
 * office is, how far a check-in/check-out is allowed to be from it, and
 * whether that distance is enforced at all.
 *
 * Exists as its own table rather than more columns on Company, mirroring
 * PayrollSettings - this is attendance policy, not company identity, and it
 * carries its own permission.
 *
 * Enforcement defaults off and the coordinates default unset, so an existing
 * company sees no change in attendance behaviour until an owner deliberately
 * configures a location.
